# Bio

I am an Honorary Associate Professor in the School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney. I am a member of the Computer Human Adapted Interaction (CHAI) Group led by Professor Judy Kay. I have interests in context aware systems, message delivery systems, customisation/personalisation using user models and related areas.

I am particularly interested in Simple Systems – novel interfaces that are easy to use yet efficient and effective.

“Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse, complexity sells better.” Edsger W. Dijkstra

“Any darn fool can make something more Complex. It takes a genius to make something simple.” Pete Seeger
